=== 0.3.0 / 2009-02-02

Repackaged as watircraft gem version 0.3.0.

Features

* You can now get a list of the script/generate commands that are available to
  you by typing "script/generate" from the root of your project. Currently these
  are *page*, *spec* and *steps*. However, additional generators will be made 
  available in future versions of this framework, as well as other plug-ins.

User Visible Changes

* Renamed Gem from "taza" to "watircraft".
* Rename "taza" command to "watircraft".
* Removed flow generator. Plan is to use Watirloo's use case class instead.
* Now uses rspec version 1.1.12.

Technical Changes

* Merged in changes from Taza 0.8.2., including
  * Fix a bug in filters leading to infinite regress.
* Added rake task for Manifest.txt.
* Renamed generator_helper from taza to watircraft.
* Removed partials. Need to review how to provide this functionality in 
  watircraft.
* Taza generators are now WatirCraft generators.
* Executable version number is now automatically built from VERSION.yml.
  (With taza, you had to maintain this by hand)
  

=== Beta 2 / 2009-01-23

Fixes

  field commands.
* Fix bug preventing the cucumber command from working. 

Known Bugs

* Cucumber command will only work when run from the root of the project. 

Update Notes

Like Beta 1, this is delivered as a gem called taza version 0.8.1. You should
delete that one before installing this one.

If you already have a project created with Beta 1, you will need to add the
following code to the top of your lib/<project_name>.rb file:

  APP_ROOT = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(FILE), '..')) unless defined?(APP_ROOT)

=== Beta 1 / 2009-01-14

Summary of Features

* Tests can be configured to work with different environments.
* Rich page classes simplify tests, and make theme easier to read and maintain.
* Support for both rspec and cucumber style tests.
* Defined pages can be used with both rspec and cucumber tests.
* Generate scripts create templates for pages, specs (rspec tests) and steps (for cucumber tests).

Known Bugs

* Support for FireWatir is incomplete (specifically: Page fields)
* Flows are not supported.
* Need to merge with latest version of taza/master.
* Need to update to latest version of rspec (1.1.12)
* Page fields do not support Radio lists.

Differences from Taza/Master

This version is delivered as a gem purporting to be taza version 0.8.1. This
will be fixed in a future release.
